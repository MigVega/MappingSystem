Welcome to the **Open-Source 3D Mapping System** project! This repository contains everything you need to build your own 3D mapping system, including **3D-printable modular parts**, sensor initialization scripts, and code to start SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems. You'll also find code for **data recording** from the sensors.

## Overview

ü§ñ **Want to build your own 3D mapping system?** You're in the right place!

I've just open-sourced the **3D-printable modular parts** that allow you to build a versatile system for both **robots** and **handheld** applications. These components were originally designed for the **Go1-legged robot**, but can be adapted for use with any robot with a flat surface, or even used as a standalone handheld system.

You can explore and download the 3D-printable parts from the following link:

üëâ **[Download 3D Parts](https://a360.co/46tjrIc)**

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Compatible with different configurations for robots or handheld systems.
- **Supports**: 
  - **Ouster 3D LiDAR**
  - **4 Intel D435i RealSense cameras**
  - **NUC mini PC**
  - **Two batteries**
- Automatic initialization of sensors and starting SLAM systems.
- Easy recording of data for research and analysis.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with the system:

1. **Download the 3D parts** and assemble the hardware components according to your use case (robot or handheld).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MigVeg/MappingSystem.git
   ```

3. Follow the setup guide to initialize the sensors and start the SLAM system, you can do that simply by runing the following command:
   ```bash
   bash auto_run
   ```
   
4. If you plan to use the data later, it‚Äôs advisable to focus on recording only and avoid running the SLAM system simultaneously. The SLAM system is resource-intensive and can quickly discharge the batteries.

## 3D Parts

The modular mounting system allows easy attachment of sensors to your robot or for handheld use. It's originally designed for the **Go1-legged robot**, but its flexibility makes it usable for any robotic platform with a flat surface.

## SLAM System

The code in this repository allows you to initialize the following sensors:

- **Ouster 3D LiDAR**
- **4 x Intel D435i RealSense cameras**

Once the sensors are initialized, you can start the SLAM system and capture live data. You can also record this data for further research and analysis.
